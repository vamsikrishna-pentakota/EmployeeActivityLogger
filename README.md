# EmployeeActivityLogger
Employee Activity Logger is a web application I developed during my internship at the RINL Visakhapatnam Steel Plant.  

Our project The Employee Activity Logger is typically a Web Application that caters the much needed functionalities of the daily working employees under the Steel Plant hood. Not only simply catering the needs but we have taken all the efforts to enhance the efficiency of carrying out their tasks at a comparatively much swifter and flawless fashion.
The actual ingredients of the Employee Activity Logger are as follows: 
To start with, the Database used in this project was ORACLE 11g Express Edition. The Oracle Database 11g Express Edition (Oracle Database XE) is an entry-level, small-footprint database based on the Oracle Database 11g Release 2 code base. This is purely a relational database and we had used a total of 3 tables, which sufficiently fulfilled the needs of our projectâ€™s data storage.
The tables along with their constraints are illustrated though the following sequence of snippets.
